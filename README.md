# Unicorns-Landscape

An infographic created for the Maven challenge.

In the infographic, I showed the situation of unicorns in the world. In finance, a unicorn is a private startup with a current valuation of $1 billion or more, across technology centres around the world.

Trying to highlight what the trends were, in particular it was seen that covid accelerated the growth of companies in different sectors, such as fintech and Internet Software and Service.

Furthermore, data analysis shows that it is less and less rare to meet a unicorn in the world, and the place that gives the best conditions for companies to become Unicorns is still the US.
